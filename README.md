# Kart engine

## resume ##
Basic engine used to create kart games, including a top view system based on JavaScript canvases translation and scaling features.

At this day, the engine can:
- handle **projection of a map** (global view and top view), 
- **player inputs** and **karts movements** with acceleration and deceleration feelings. 
- **Collisions** and **triggers** using a simple pixels mask system, which represents region of interest of the map.


It is also possible to **add other karts drived by AI** (there is a list of other karts managed by the engine that you can populate, but **you must manage the AI behaviour by your self** for now)
